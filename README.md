# Natural Framework

Wrapper around deno KV to build elastic entities.

Idea:
 - atom - primitive
 - molecule - entity (build of atoms)
 - cell - long living durable process
 - organism - namespace for data
 - runtime - contains services and repository

You can store simple atom, or molecule. Mutate them, use it in cells.

This is just concept phase of project - WIP
